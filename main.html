    <p>“The statistics on sanity are that one out of every four people is suffering from a mental illness. Look at your 3 best friends. If they're ok, then it's you.” (Rita Mae Brown)</p>
    <p>Our world is one where humans no longer have to fight to survive, you just go to work and contribute to society, which you get money from to buy food, water and everything you really need. One of the few "problems" that still affect modern humans is mental health. Generally we do not understand the mind very well, it's probably one of the most mysterious things to humans and it's inside your own body. A large part of todays life is coping with living, with suicide rates on the rise and more and more people being diagnosed with issues and prescribed drugs to manage them. Most people, even if they don't directly have mental illness are impacted by it, as 1/4 people have some kind of mental health condition. Depression is a very common thing that very many people are being treated for. Taking care of your mind is one of the most important things for modern humans, and one of the biggest ways we do this is with art. Art can really be anything, music, writing, poems, architecture. Art, in my experience for most people is about expression and trying to get how you feel out into the world.

    <p>As the world has evolved so have we, for better or worse, things like war monuments to fallen people, illustrates how much art can mean even to the average person. Yugoslavian war monuments adopted a "Brutalist" kind of style during, and after the 2nd world war, instead of just making a giant statue of a soldier, they would make monuments which were huge concrete structures, usually towering over any person who views it, made from vague shapes and buildings, and really representing the resistance against Nazi occupation during World War II. Yugoslavia was occupied by a lot of parties, off and on through these wars. The really core part of the culture, and lives of people who call yugoslavia home were definitely impacted, but they continued to preserve through many different issues.

    <p>These Yugoslavian war monuments are something that mean a lot, to a lot of people, a giant monolith to the violence and suffering experienced during the second world war.

    <p>Zdzislaw Beksinski was a polish painter and photographer, influenced heavily by the aftermath of the war, and the soviet occupation of his country. Zdzislaw Beksinski had no formal training in his art, but as he learned the history and influence of architecture and art, he started making photography, very evocative and dream-like. In this time the goal of anyone who wanted to be taken seriously, was to make pictures of as much realism and just presenting the world as it is, gorgeous landscapes, anything to show the world how it looks. Zdzislaw Beksinski did not want to properly represent anything, people even calling his art "anti photography"

    <p>Today, letting anyone express whatever they want is what art is for, and you should not label things like this as not art because you don't like it. Which is definitely a prevalent issue with “modern art” which through the course of my life, many people have said they find pointless and unskilled. Really focusing on how much skill a painting, photo, or song might take, just so see bananas taped to a wall sell for ungodly amounts of money as so called “modern art”. You can call this not art, but by definition it is, just because a movie is really bad and has no effort in it does not make it not a movie, although nobody would watch that movie anyway.</p>
    <p>Zdzislaw Beksinski did not like to name art, because he wanted people to interpret his works however they wanted, famously saying "If I wanted to say something' I would write it down or say it". Zdzislaw Beksinski's art is, in my opinion, stunning, and speaks for itself, in different ways to different people. His art was heavily influenced by war and mostly something that a viewer could look at for hours, complex landscapes or architecture typically with creatures of some kind, usually horrifying and dreamlike in nature. Zdzislaw Beksinski wanted his paintings to stand on their own, just as an image to look at not any specific meaning or value, evoking emotion but not really having some special story or meaning that everyone should know. "Meaning is meaningless to me, I do not care for symbolism and I paint what I paint without meditating on a story."</p>

    <p>Fear and loathing in Las Vegas is a strong critique on American ideals, which focuses on the rampant consumerism and the death of the American dream through the lens of a drug-fueled journey through Las Vegas. The “Gonzo” journalism that Hunter S Thompson created with stories like this, really does allow journalists to put their own opinion into their pieces, in very grotesque ways still filled with bits of real events. In these stories, instead of the story like the Kentucky derby which Thompson was supposed to report on, the story is instead about the journalist, and their own personal experience of writing the story in the first place. Thompson’s rampant drug use is a big cornerstone of the story, which starts by critiquing all the people who come to these derbys as mad drunks who keep losing money. Through the course of the story, there's beasts that Thompson describes which he came to watch, and he finds the most interesting, most grotesque, rambling, mad drunkard and it's his own self, and his “attorney” who comes along with him. This movie was not well received at all, journalists summed it up as just a crazy drug movie about two horrible people, with no deeper meaning. Even though originally, the story which was released as a book was received as an amazing work of art which was unique, fun to read at times but also completely disgusting at others. The same things that this story was loved for, was exactly what made people hate it in movie form.</p>

    <p>“No sympathy for the devil; keep that in mind. Buy the ticket, take the ride...and if it occasionally gets a little heavier than what you had in mind, well...maybe chalk it up to forced consciousness expansion: Tune in, freak out, get beaten.” (Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas)</p>
    <p>Art, in its many forms, symbolizes the internal struggles of individuals and societies alike. Whether through war monuments, surrealist paintings, or unconventional journalism, these works validate the idea that expression is essential to understanding and coping with the human condition. The space and feeling that all of these stories create are that of a very deranged person, like Gregor or the woman from the yellow wallpaper. Either being slowly forgotten by your family or your husband, left to your own sanity, with only the things around you to keep you entertained. Eventually the protagonist in both stories experiences some kind of death, or change like fear and loathing in las vegas where the protagonist slowly realizes his own depravity. Or the suffering of people caused by war, leading to art like the monuments in yugoslavia or Zdzislaw Beksinski’s photos which broke the rules set by everyone else, and finally realizing his own artistic vision through paintings. The yellow wallpaper itself is something to wonder about, what would it really look like if it were real, twisted by your mind into various images. The mental capacity of every person to become insane, something which is still misunderstood with complex conditions like schizophrenia being portrayed as the crazy guy who believes in conspiracy theories and sees people where there aren’t. The style of stories about mental illness usually is very unconventional, communicating something most people can’t imagine even with how common it is. The idea of mental depravity and deterioration summarizes something no single person could ever understand, every different condition presenting differently in different people with little to no knowledge of the cause of any of it.

    <h1>My artist statement</h1>
    <p>Each piece that I chose is something that influences me in some way, like the yellow wallpaper and metamorphosis both did. They all have something to do with mental illness and overall just build a sort of space that I think well represents the ideas of the pieces, which each have their own foundation in the yellow wallpaper or metamorphosis. The first piece which I chose was The yugoslavian war monuments, I think this ties my piece to a real world place, a space which is tangible and could be visited if you wanted to. The brutalist architecture is definitely one of the kinds of arts that is in between our modern art and previous art, like the yellow wallpaper or metamorphosis. The mental illness many people experience has always been a part of history, but never fully recognized until the current day. Even currently people with mental illness are treated unfairly and commonly misunderstood, like Jane is misunderstood and left on her own commonly. Gregor is also treated extremely poorly by his family for being a giant insect, which isn’t his fault but it's enough for his own sister to want him dead. Gregor's situation is eerily similar to how we treat people with mental illness, most average people if they suddenly developed a serious mental health condition would not know what to do about it, and most people who even bother to get diagnosed don't even get treatment.
    </p>
    <p>The next piece I had chosen is the photos of Zdzisław Beksiński, specifically a photo he took depicting a woman with a hole in her face, like someone took a lighter to a polaroid and burned the face away. In current day discussions of mental illness, people with mental illness are treated like an issue or a topic that can be discussed in the same way you would discuss how you feel about an object. It focuses on how the mentally disabled hurt other people with their illness, not how it hurts them or how they are mistreated. Especially because people with mental illness are much more likely to have parents with mental illness, who may struggle to effectively help their children when they are struggling themselves. Jane in the yellow wallpaper had just given birth to a child, but in her state she likely could not take care of the baby on her own. Metamorphosis is a perfect example of this, with how his family is much more concerned about how he's no longer able to generate income or help than how it would have been if they themselves have turned into an insect, there is no sense of empathy. Zdzisław Beksiński does not want people to try to interpret his work, I can’t say why he made this picture or if it has any specific meaning. Every person staring at a piece of art will likely reach a different conclusion. What I can say is the image gives me a sense of uncanniness, the hole is like a giant eye, letting you stare straight into this person but also having it stare straight back. The images Jane sees on the wallpaper are mostly human figures, necks broken, women creeping around or locked behind bars. Jane seems to feel trapped in her own mind, and by her own husband whether he was actually her husband or not.
    </p>
    <p>The next piece is one of my favorites, also being by Zdzisław Beksiński you can stare at it for hours and notice so many things. The time Zdzisław Beksiński made this painting was one where war and death was all around him. The many faces and people molding together into a giant structure feels very similar to the giant brutalist architecture, towering and looming over the viewer giving this sense of entrapment. Humans like to be preoccupied with themself, most religions being something bigger than themselves, is comforting. An entity of some kind who created everything is an interesting idea, without it there is no definable purpose or reason to live that you can pinpoint. 

    </p>
    <p>The background which I made for the site, and the original page you land on with images and text flashing on the screen are a representation of the mental illness someone experiences. The struggle to find a reason to live, and the idea of nihilism and suicide are very prevalant today. Less and less people subscribe to some belief that there is even some great purpose, just wanting to make some positive change in the world or even just wanting to live a life you find exciting or fulfilling is much more common now. The background is a collage in a way, of many images from the pieces a I chose as well as eyes, or anything to add to that unsettling feeling you get when you stare at a painting by Zdzisław Beksiński. I even took portions of this text that I wrote and blended it into the background, using tools which make images melt together in a way that is interesting to view. I want it to feel like as you view this website it stares at you back, and all the pieces within are incorporated into a giant textured monolith.</p>
    <p>The next piece I chose is one from Ralph Steadman, an amazing artist who creates these grotesque and disturbing images. That image is one of a conference, with a bunch of police men talking about how drugs are terrible, and marijuana is the work of the devil, all while smoking on their cigarettes. The whole movie is about drugs, really about how absurd the commonly held worldviews even today are, with most people never being able to ever fully grasp the world in a meaningful way, and even the people who do make a difference not ever learning of all the suffering that goes on every day. 
    </p>
    <p>After this my only pieces I included were an album which I have not fully listened to, so I’m not sure I really want to touch on it as if I know what it's meant to be. What I do want to say is that it is extremely chaotic and definitely has a basis in mental illness. The album feels like this pure suffering, the distortion that is almost constant adds to the feeling of an ethereal beast that devours everything. </p>
    <p>I also have an image which depicts the yellow wallpaper, which is something you can never truly and accurately depict. I think the image feels more warming and pleasant than what is described in the story, but as the story goes the character does really start to like the wallpaper, hating it but also enjoying looking at it. There's definitely things you can see within the image but I think the background I designed, while not yellow or wallpaper it is the first thing I made, an amalgamation of the ideas. If you stare at it long enough you can probably make things out in its words, images and a wild array of colors. On its own this image can hold all of the ideas this text could ever express and more, being that it has almost the entirety of this text hidden in it somewhere as well as many images. I chose all these images and pieces of art because yes, they mean something to me but also because they do connect to the ideas of the stories, yellow wallpaper and metamorphosis. The strong feelings that all these pieces provoke can be interpreted in any way you want, maybe it won't even make you feel much at all.
